Hi there. Welcome to Pic Puller for Craft.

Take a look at documentation, PPfC_docs_v1.md, which should be next to this file in the directory.

This is still BETA software. At some point as I add more functionality and continue to maintain it, I will probably charge for it. I just don't want that to come as a shock. Cheers.
